# Computational Math Project

The project consists of two problems with differential equations which describe the movements of a drone. The first one is an initial value problem solved using Euler's method and Euler's improved method. The second is a simplification of the drone's vertical motion description using a linear differential equation. The transfer function is found using Laplace transform and the diff. equation is again solved using Euler's method and Euler's improved method. A full mathematical explaination can be found in the report. <br> <br>The solutions are implemented in the respective C programs. The programs output the solutions' results in `.dat`. files which were afterwards plotted into graphs using GNUPlot in order to compare the two methods.
